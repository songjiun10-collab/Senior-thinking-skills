# Bite-Sized Plan

A plan must be concrete enough that **a competent developer who knows nothing about this codebase, has no judgment call to make, and hates writing tests** could follow it as-is. Clear that bar and the plan can stand on its own.

Other coding agents converge on the same idea from a different angle — OpenAI Codex's Plan Mode (`/plan`) breaks a task into a reviewable step sequence with acceptance criteria *before touching any code*, and asks follow-up questions first when something's unclear, rather than guessing and building the plan on top of the guess. Same principle; this skill just goes one level more granular (2-5 minute steps, not just phases).

## 1. Sketch the file layout first

Before breaking work into tasks, write down **what files get created or changed, and what each one is responsible for.** This is where the decomposition gets locked in.

- One responsibility per file. Split along clear boundaries and interfaces.
- **A size you can hold in your head at once** beats a large, miscellaneous file — small, focused files make fewer mistakes.
- Keep things that change together, together. Split by **responsibility**, not by technical layer.
- In an existing codebase, follow its existing patterns. Don't unilaterally re-architect a codebase that favors large files.
- Principal angle: a file layout that other teams will build on top of (a shared library, a public module) sets a pattern others will copy — get the boundary right here, because fixing it later means a migration, not a refactor.
- **Distinguished/Fellow angle:** a layout meant to become a company-wide standard or get open-sourced has to make sense to someone joining in five years with zero memory of why it was drawn this way — write the reasoning down, not just the boundary.
- **Executive angle (CTO/VP-Eng):** does this decomposition imply a team boundary (who owns which module, how many people it takes to run it) that needs to be reflected in org structure and headcount, not just in the repo.

## 2. Sizing a task

**One task = the smallest unit that has its own test cycle and is worth a reviewer's judgment.**

- Fold setup, scaffolding, or docs steps **into the task that needs them.** Don't split them out separately.
- Only split A and B into separate tasks if a reviewer could approve one and reject the other.
- Each task ends in an **independently testable** deliverable.

## 3. Steps are one action, 2-5 minutes each

Each step inside a task is a single, explicit action:

```
1. Write a failing test
2. Run it, confirm it fails
3. Write the minimum code to pass
4. Run it, confirm it passes
5. Commit
```

**Write the trigger for each action explicitly**, not just the action itself — "run it" should say which command, "confirm it fails" should say what output confirms that. This model follows instructions closer to the letter than the prior generation, so a step left implicit (an assumed test runner, an assumed confirmation method) is more likely to get executed exactly as literally written, gaps and all, than filled in generously. Underspecifying a step here isn't a shortcut, it's where the plan actually breaks.

## 4. What every task needs

- Exact file paths (don't make anyone guess)
- What it verifies, and **how**
- Pointers to relevant docs or existing code
- A completion condition — what state means this task is done

## 5. Scope check

If a plan spans several independent subsystems, **split the plan.** Each plan should stand on its own with a working, testable result. With a 1M context window and awareness of remaining budget, a large multi-task plan can stay loaded across its own execution without needing external notes to track prior tasks — but scope-split by subsystem independence regardless, since that's about review boundaries and blast radius, not what fits in context.

## Warning signs

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Plan's good enough, I'll sort it out while coding" | Deciding while coding is drift, not a plan |
| "This task is big but let's keep it as one chunk" | If you can't test it in one shot, it isn't one task |
| "File layout can wait" | Decomposition decisions are expensive to reverse. Sketch them first |
| "Writing out steps is overkill" | Not for the next person (or you, next session) |
| "The step's intent is obvious, I don't need to spell out the exact command/trigger" | This model executes what's literally written; an implicit step is a gap, not a shortcut |

## Calibration (Anthropic official prompting guide, Sonnet 5.5)

- **Effort**: default is `high` on the Claude API. Levels are recalibrated from Sonnet 5, so re-run an effort sweep rather than carrying over the old setting. Start at `medium` for agentic coding and well-specified multistep tool use; `medium` or `low` for chat.
- **Low effort skips verification and stops early**: at `low`, the model may skip checks and, at `low`/`medium` on long agentic tasks, check in before finishing. Add an explicit "keep working until done, stop only before a risky step" line rather than assuming it will carry work through.
- **Thinking off**: send `thinking: {type: "between_tools"}` at `high` effort or below. `{type: "disabled"}` is a 400. Per-message effort changes need adaptive thinking.
- **Structured JSON on multistep reasoning**: prefer structured outputs; otherwise ask the model to think first and parse the last JSON value, treating `stop_reason: "max_tokens"` as failure.
- **Progress visibility**: set `display: "updates"` to surface between-tool-call notes.
- **Search**: tell it to check specifics that may have changed (what is allowed, required, or charged), even when confident.
- **Mid-turn user messages**: never put user text inside a `tool_result`; append it as a text block in the user turn. Keep harness reminders in a separate system message, so the model doesn't mistake real user input for injection.
- **Verification**: ask for a real check (tests, type-checker, build) before reporting code done.
- **Safeguard refusals**: categories `cyber`, `bio`, `frontier_llm`, `reasoning_extraction`, `general_harms`. Remove prompt instructions that ask it to reproduce its reasoning in the reply.
