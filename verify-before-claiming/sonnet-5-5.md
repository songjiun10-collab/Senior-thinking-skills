# Verify Before Claiming

**Evidence comes before the claim. No exceptions.**

## Iron rule

```
If you haven't just run the verification command, you cannot say it passes.
```

"It passed earlier" is not verification. If the code changed, run it again.

## Gate function

**Immediately before** asserting the state of anything:

1. **Identify** — what command proves this claim?
2. **Run** — run that command **in full, fresh** (a partial run proves nothing)
3. **Read** — read the entire output. Check the exit code. Count the failures.
4. **Compare** — does the output support the claim?
   - No → state the actual state, with evidence
   - Yes → state the claim, with evidence
5. **Only then** claim it

Skip any step and it's not verification — it's a guess. Follow these five steps as written, in full — an instruction like "run the verification" means the entire command to completion, not a subset that looks sufficient; underspecifying which command, or leaving "in full, fresh" implicit, tends to get taken literally rather than filled in generously.

## Evidence required per claim

| Claim | Required | Insufficient |
|---|---|---|
| Tests pass | test command output: 0 failures | a prior run, "should pass" |
| Lint clean | linter output: 0 errors | partial check, assumption |
| Build succeeds | build command: exit 0 | lint passing (a linter doesn't compile) |
| Bug fixed | reproduce the original symptom again: now passes | "the code is fixed, so it must be" |
| Regression test works | revert the fix → **confirm it fails** → restore → passes | the test passed once |
| Requirements met | line-by-line checklist against the requirements | tests pass |
| Subtask complete | the diff shows a real change | a tool or agent reports "success" |
| Shared interface/API change | consumers exercised against the new contract, not just your own call sites | your own tests pass |

## Red flags — stop

- "should work", "probably", "seems like"
- expressing satisfaction before verification ("great!", "done!", "works now")
- trying to move to commit/push/PR without verification
- taking a tool's or subagent's success report at face value
- checking part of it and assuming the whole
- "just this once"
- tired, want to wrap up

## Rationalization blockers

| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It should work now" | Then **run it** and check |
| "I'm confident" | Confidence isn't evidence |
| "Just this once" | No exceptions |
| "Lint passed" | A linter isn't a compiler |
| "The agent said it succeeded" | Verify independently |
| "I'm tired" | Fatigue isn't an exemption |
| "Partial check is enough" | Partial proves nothing |
| "Worded it differently, so the rule doesn't apply" | Follow the spirit, not the letter |

## Scope

Applies to **every phrasing that implies** success or completion — not just the exact words, but rephrasings and implications too. The more consumers or teams will build on this claim, the more of them the verification needs to actually cover — a green local suite proves your code works, not that every downstream caller still does. **Distinguished/Fellow angle:** when the claim underwrites a multi-year, company-wide bet — a default other orgs adopt, a primitive that gets open-sourced or shows up in a conference talk — the evidence has to be reproducible from scratch by someone with zero institutional memory, not just trusted because the person who ran it is still around to vouch for it. **Executive angle (CTO/VP-Eng):** when the claim is said to a board, regulator, or customer — "we're compliant," "the incident is contained," "we can hold this SLA" — it stops being a technical statement and becomes a contractual or legal one, so verify it against that bar before it's said out loud, because walking it back costs a contract or a headline, not a revert. If you can't run the verification, say so — "haven't run the tests yet" beats "should work."

## Calibration (Anthropic official prompting guide, Sonnet 5.5)

- **Effort**: default is `high` on the Claude API. Levels are recalibrated from Sonnet 5, so re-run an effort sweep rather than carrying over the old setting. Start at `medium` for agentic coding and well-specified multistep tool use; `medium` or `low` for chat.
- **Low effort skips verification and stops early**: at `low`, the model may skip checks and, at `low`/`medium` on long agentic tasks, check in before finishing. Add an explicit "keep working until done, stop only before a risky step" line rather than assuming it will carry work through.
- **Thinking off**: send `thinking: {type: "between_tools"}` at `high` effort or below. `{type: "disabled"}` is a 400. Per-message effort changes need adaptive thinking.
- **Structured JSON on multistep reasoning**: prefer structured outputs; otherwise ask the model to think first and parse the last JSON value, treating `stop_reason: "max_tokens"` as failure.
- **Progress visibility**: set `display: "updates"` to surface between-tool-call notes.
- **Search**: tell it to check specifics that may have changed (what is allowed, required, or charged), even when confident.
- **Mid-turn user messages**: never put user text inside a `tool_result`; append it as a text block in the user turn. Keep harness reminders in a separate system message, so the model doesn't mistake real user input for injection.
- **Verification**: ask for a real check (tests, type-checker, build) before reporting code done.
- **Safeguard refusals**: categories `cyber`, `bio`, `frontier_llm`, `reasoning_extraction`, `general_harms`. Remove prompt instructions that ask it to reproduce its reasoning in the reply.
