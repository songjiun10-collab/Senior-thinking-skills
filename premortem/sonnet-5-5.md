# Premortem

Ask **"when does this break"** before asking "does this work." Do it after the fact and defensive code gets bolted on piecemeal; do it up front and the structure itself changes.

This model follows instructions more literally than prior generations — an underspecified premortem prompt ("check for edge cases") gets taken narrowly rather than generously expanded. Name the categories that actually apply (I/O, concurrency, persisted state, external calls) explicitly rather than assuming they'll be inferred.

## Where it breaks

- Input empty, null, or 100x larger than expected?
- Network, file, or external API fails — or responds **slowly**? (a timeout is harder to handle than an outright failure)
- The same code runs twice concurrently? A duplicate request arrives?
- The process dies mid-operation — does data end up **half-written**?
- Encoding, timezone, floating point — anything that drifts silently?
- Principal angle: if this fails, does the blast radius stay inside this codebase, or does it corrupt shared state, a downstream team's data, or a contract another service depends on? Scope the premortem to the actual blast radius, not just the local function.
- Distinguished/Fellow angle: for a foundational piece, run the premortem against company-wide scale two or three years out, not next quarter's traffic — a failure mode that's rare today becomes routine once every team is running on it.
- Executive angle (CTO/VP-Eng): does the failure mode carry regulatory exposure, customer-trust damage, or competitive fallout beyond an engineering incident — the kind of risk a board or investor would ask about — and does containing it require more on-call headcount than you currently have?

You don't have to answer every question. Pick the ones that actually apply to this piece of work, and decide whether to defend against each or deliberately skip it. **If you skip one, say so in writing.**

## How would you notice a failure

Code that fails silently is far more dangerous than code that fails loudly.

- If this fails in production, **who** finds out, and **how**?
- Are you swallowing exceptions? (`except: pass`, an empty catch block)
- Does the error message actually help find the cause? Does it include **which value** was the problem?
- Is there a path that fails but looks like success? (partial success, an empty result returned as if complete)

With 1M context and adaptive thinking on by default, there's room to walk the full failure list against a large diff or a whole subsystem in one pass rather than trimming scope prematurely — but since instructions are followed literally, say so explicitly if you want the wider sweep rather than a narrow one.

## Calibration (Anthropic official prompting guide, Sonnet 5.5)

- **Effort**: default is `high` on the Claude API. Levels are recalibrated from Sonnet 5, so re-run an effort sweep rather than carrying over the old setting. Start at `medium` for agentic coding and well-specified multistep tool use; `medium` or `low` for chat.
- **Low effort skips verification and stops early**: at `low`, the model may skip checks and, at `low`/`medium` on long agentic tasks, check in before finishing. Add an explicit "keep working until done, stop only before a risky step" line rather than assuming it will carry work through.
- **Thinking off**: send `thinking: {type: "between_tools"}` at `high` effort or below. `{type: "disabled"}` is a 400. Per-message effort changes need adaptive thinking.
- **Structured JSON on multistep reasoning**: prefer structured outputs; otherwise ask the model to think first and parse the last JSON value, treating `stop_reason: "max_tokens"` as failure.
- **Progress visibility**: set `display: "updates"` to surface between-tool-call notes.
- **Search**: tell it to check specifics that may have changed (what is allowed, required, or charged), even when confident.
- **Mid-turn user messages**: never put user text inside a `tool_result`; append it as a text block in the user turn. Keep harness reminders in a separate system message, so the model doesn't mistake real user input for injection.
- **Verification**: ask for a real check (tests, type-checker, build) before reporting code done.
- **Safeguard refusals**: categories `cyber`, `bio`, `frontier_llm`, `reasoning_extraction`, `general_harms`. Remove prompt instructions that ask it to reproduce its reasoning in the reply.
