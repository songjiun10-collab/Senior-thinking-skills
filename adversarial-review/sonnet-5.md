# Disprove-Biased Review

A confident answer isn't the same as a correct one. The longer a session runs, the more quietly assumptions harden into "facts." This skill pulls out a review posture **biased to disprove, not approve** — **before** the finished result exists.

**This isn't a verdict on finished work.** It's interrogating a decision while it's still in flight, while course-correction is still cheap.

## When it applies — the bar for "non-trivial"

Any one of these makes it non-trivial:

- introduces or changes branching logic
- crosses a module or service boundary
- claims a property the type system or compiler can't verify (thread-safety, idempotency, ordering, invariants)
- correctness depends on context a future reader can't see
- it's irreversible (production deploy, data migration, public API change)
- it crosses a team or service ownership boundary, or sets a pattern other teams are likely to copy — the review then has to ask what happens elsewhere if this spreads, not just whether it's correct here
- **Distinguished/Fellow angle:** if it could become company-wide doctrine, get open-sourced, or get cited in a conference talk competitors watch, the disproof has to hold up for years and outside the building — would it still survive review from someone joining in five years with none of the institutional memory behind it?
- **Executive angle (CTO/VP-Eng):** if it changes headcount or team shape, commits to vendor/infra spend, or moves regulatory, competitive, or customer-trust risk (a build-vs-buy call, a data-access grant, killing a team), the disproof needs a reviewer who'd have to defend that budget or that risk to a board, not just someone who'd maintain the resulting code.

**Doesn't apply**: mechanical work (renames, formatting, moving files), following an explicit instruction as given, reading or summarizing existing code, an obviously-correct one-line change. **Suspect every keystroke and nothing ships** — apply this only when the bar above is actually met.

**Be explicit about the bar, not just the spirit of it.** This model follows instructions more literally than its predecessor — if "non-trivial" is left to a vague sense of judgment rather than checked against the list above, an underspecified review request is more likely to get taken at face value ("just glance at it") than generously expanded into a real disproof pass. State plainly when the bar is met and that a full adversarial pass is warranted, rather than assuming that's understood.

## Procedure

1. **Claim** — compress it into two or three lines, in the form "X is safe because Y." If you can't phrase it that way, it's a feeling, not a decision.
2. **Extract** — keep only the **output and its contract** needed for review. Strip the reasoning that got you there. Hand over the reasoning too and you just get agreement with that reasoning. Shrink it to something reviewable at a glance — split it first if you can't.
3. **Disprove** — frame the request **adversarially**. Not "does this look OK?" but **"find what's wrong with this."** The question's phrasing decides the answer. State this framing explicitly rather than trusting it to be inferred — literal instruction-following means the exact phrasing of the ask matters even more than usual here.
4. **Reconcile** — take what comes back and check each point against the actual output text; sort into: real defect / already handled / out of scope.
5. **Stop condition** — stop once only minor points remain, after three passes, or when the user says it's enough.

## Core principles

**Framing decides the answer.** Ask "is this a problem?" and the easy answer is no. Ask "find the problem in this" and one actually gets found. The wording of the review request determines the quality of the review.

**Only stripped context makes it a real review.** Hand over the reasoning that led to the conclusion and you get a review that's been talked into that reasoning. Hand over only the output and its contract.

**Decisions with wide blast radius need reviewers who don't share your stake in them.** A choice other teams will build interfaces on top of, or copy as precedent, deserves a reviewer who isn't invested in your original reasoning being right — self-review from inside the same context tends to confirm rather than disprove.

**With a 1M context window and context-awareness of remaining budget**, a large claim, its full dependency chain, and prior review passes can stay loaded through all three stop-condition passes without needing to re-fetch or summarize away detail — use that room rather than compressing the claim's supporting evidence prematurely, but don't confuse "it fits" with "it should all be loaded"; step 2's extraction still applies so the reviewer sees only the output and its contract, not the whole session's reasoning trail.
