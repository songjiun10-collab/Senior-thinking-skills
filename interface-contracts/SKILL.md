description: Design public interfaces so that observable behavior becomes an implicit promise — Hyrum's Law and contract-first API design. Use when designing REST/GraphQL endpoints, module boundaries, type contracts between files, component props, or any surface where one piece of code talks to another. Complements design-for-the-next-reader with a sharper focus on what you're accidentally promising.

# Interface contracts

The discipline is the same everywhere — Hyrum's Law, contract-first design, the one-version rule — but how it's applied is calibrated per model. Pick the file for the model actually running:

| Model | File |
|---|---|
| Claude Opus 5.5 | `opus-5-5.md` |
| Claude Fable 5.1 / Claude Mythos 5.1 | `fable-5-1.md` |
| Claude Sonnet 5 | `sonnet-5.md` |
| OpenAI GPT-6 Astra | `gpt-6-astra.md` |
| OpenAI GPT-6 Sol | `gpt-6-sol.md` |
| OpenAI GPT-6 Luna | `gpt-6-luna.md` |

Read the file matching the model actually running before applying this skill.

**Running a model not listed above** (Claude Haiku 4.5, Claude Opus 5, an older generation, a different model family entirely)? `sonnet-5.md` carries the fullest general-purpose version of the underlying procedure — read that one rather than skipping this skill. Haiku 4.5 has no `effort` parameter and a 200K context window (not 1M): apply the discipline, but skip that file's effort-level and context-window specifics — they don't hold for Haiku.
