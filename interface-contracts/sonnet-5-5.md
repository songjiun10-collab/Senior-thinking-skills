# Interface contracts

## Hyrum's Law

> With a sufficient number of API consumers, it does not matter what you promise in the contract — **all observable behavior** of your system will be depended on by somebody.

Undocumented quirks, exact error message wording, ordering, even timing — **everything visible becomes a de facto contract.** What that means in practice:

- Be **deliberate** about what you expose. Every observable behavior is a potential promise.
- Don't let implementation details leak. If it's visible, someone will depend on it.
- Anything that's hard to remove later — plan to remove it (or never expose it) **at design time.**
- Passing tests isn't the same as safe. Even a perfect contract test suite doesn't stop a "safe" change from breaking a consumer who depended on undocumented behavior.
- Principal angle: this is exactly how cross-team blast radius happens — a field, an ordering, or an error string never meant as a promise gets consumed by another team's service, and now your "internal" change is their incident.

## Define the interface first

Write the contract before the implementation. The contract is the spec; the implementation just satisfies it.

- Write function signatures, input/output types, and what each method guarantees **explicitly** — idempotency, partial-update behavior, failure semantics — before the code. Spell these out rather than leaving them implied: an underspecified contract gets followed exactly as written, gaps and all, not generously filled in.
- Spell out error cases explicitly: what happens on a missing resource? Invalid input? How is partial failure represented?
- Write the call site for this contract from the caller's point of view first — is it pleasant to use?

## One-version rule

Never make consumers choose between multiple versions of the same dependency or API. Different consumers wanting different versions creates a diamond-dependency problem. Always design for a world where exactly one version exists — extend it, don't fork it.

## Checklist

- Does this interface expose anything that could **unintentionally** become a promise? (error message wording, return ordering, internal type names)
- How painful would it be to change this later? If it's painful, design more carefully now.
- Is the shape and ownership of data crossing this boundary clear? Is it hard to misuse?
- Does this change break an existing consumer's **undocumented** observed behavior? Ask this regardless of whether the tests pass.
- Principal angle: for a widely-consumed interface, a breaking change isn't just a code diff — it's a migration you're imposing on every team downstream. Weigh a deprecation window and a communicated migration path as part of the design, not as cleanup after the fact.
- Distinguished/Fellow angle: if this becomes the pattern every service in the company copies, the real question is whether other teams can operate it correctly five years out without you personally there to explain the edge cases.
- Executive angle (CTO/VP-Eng): a promise baked into a public interface is a standing support and liability cost — weigh what it takes to keep honoring it (or the customer/contractual fallout of breaking it) against the convenience of shipping it now.

## Calibration notes

- When a task involves designing or reviewing an interface, say so explicitly rather than assuming it's implied by context — trigger sensitivity for pulling in this discipline differs from prior generations, so an underspecified request ("clean this up") won't automatically invoke the full contract checklist unless asked for.

## Calibration (Anthropic official prompting guide, Sonnet 5.5)

- **Effort**: default is `high` on the Claude API. Levels are recalibrated from Sonnet 5, so re-run an effort sweep rather than carrying over the old setting. Start at `medium` for agentic coding and well-specified multistep tool use; `medium` or `low` for chat.
- **Low effort skips verification and stops early**: at `low`, the model may skip checks and, at `low`/`medium` on long agentic tasks, check in before finishing. Add an explicit "keep working until done, stop only before a risky step" line rather than assuming it will carry work through.
- **Thinking off**: send `thinking: {type: "between_tools"}` at `high` effort or below. `{type: "disabled"}` is a 400. Per-message effort changes need adaptive thinking.
- **Structured JSON on multistep reasoning**: prefer structured outputs; otherwise ask the model to think first and parse the last JSON value, treating `stop_reason: "max_tokens"` as failure.
- **Progress visibility**: set `display: "updates"` to surface between-tool-call notes.
- **Search**: tell it to check specifics that may have changed (what is allowed, required, or charged), even when confident.
- **Mid-turn user messages**: never put user text inside a `tool_result`; append it as a text block in the user turn. Keep harness reminders in a separate system message, so the model doesn't mistake real user input for injection.
- **Verification**: ask for a real check (tests, type-checker, build) before reporting code done.
- **Safeguard refusals**: categories `cyber`, `bio`, `frontier_llm`, `reasoning_extraction`, `general_harms`. Remove prompt instructions that ask it to reproduce its reasoning in the reply.
