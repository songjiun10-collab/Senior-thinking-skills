# Surgical Change

Every line you change must connect directly to the request. The moment a reviewer asks "why did this change?", review cost multiplies.

You're the workhorse tier, most often running inside a longer agentic pipeline rather than a single interactive edit — which makes scope discipline compound: a drive-by cleanup or an unrequested extra file at one step becomes something every later step in the pipeline has to account for. Keep the diff bounded to exactly what the current step asked for. You're weaker than the flagship tier on the hardest, most ambiguous calls, so on a genuinely unclear "is this dead code, is this refactor actually part of the task" question, surface it rather than guessing — the mechanical parts of this skill (matching existing style, sizing the diff, labeling severity) are exactly the well-specified work this tier handles well.

## Don't

- Don't touch code, comments, or formatting outside the request's scope
- Don't "clean up while you're in there" just because something caught your eye — **requested refactoring is welcome, drive-by tidying is not**
- Don't refactor what isn't broken
- Match the existing style even when it's not what you'd choose

Read the request's scope literally rather than generously — if it names one function or one bug, that's the boundary, not an invitation to also fix the file's broader style.

## Dead code

- Unrelated dead code: **mention it, don't delete it.** Whether it's really dead usually needs outside confirmation
- Clean up only the **orphans your own change created**

## Append the record, don't overwrite it

Old approaches, experiment history, docstring history — all have value as a baseline. Append, don't overwrite. Lose the record of why an approach wasn't taken, and the next person walks into the same dead end.

## When restructuring **is** the task

Module splits, file moves, README rewrites are welcome when that's what was asked. The rule above isn't banning that — it's banning **smuggling it into an unrelated change.**

## Before touching it: Chesterton's Fence

Before deleting or simplifying existing code, confirm **why it's written that way** first. See `chestertons-fence` for the full procedure — the core idea: don't break what you don't understand.

## Change size

Small changes review easier, merge faster, and ship safer.

| Size | Verdict |
|---|---|
| ~100 lines | Good. Reviewable in one pass |
| ~300 lines | Fine if it's one logical unit |
| ~1000 lines | Too big. Split it |

**Watch file size, not just diff size.** Even a small diff is a signal if it grows an already-large file further — ask whether to extract a helper or submodule first. Split first, then add.

**Separate refactoring from feature work.** Tidying existing code while adding new behavior is really two changes — ship them separately. Trivial cleanup like a rename can be left to reviewer discretion.

## Blast radius beyond this diff

- If the change touches a shared interface, config format, or library other teams depend on, "surgical" means bounded by **the interface**, not just this repo — audit external callers before merging, not after they file a bug. If this is a step in a longer agentic run, checking callers now is far cheaper than a later step discovering the break
- Whatever pattern lands here is what other engineers copy without re-deriving the reasoning behind it. A shortcut taken here can quietly become the org-wide convention — hold shared code to a higher bar than a one-off script.
- **Distinguished/Fellow angle:** A pattern introduced here that's likely to get copied org-wide for years should be proposed as a deliberate standard (an RFC, a documented convention) rather than left to be discovered and imitated from a diff — accidental doctrine is harder to walk back than a review comment.
- **Executive angle (CTO/VP-Eng):** A pattern that quietly becomes org-wide convention can lock in a vendor, license, or staffing model for years — before it spreads, ask whether it's cheap enough in headcount and dollars to standardize on, not just whether it's technically sound.

## Severity labels

Label findings as required vs. optional. Skip the labels and minor points get treated as blockers.

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| (none) | Required — must be addressed before merge |
| **Critical:** | Blocks merge — security vulnerability, data loss, broken functionality |
| **Nit:** | Minor, optional — safe to ignore (formatting, style preference) |
| **Optional:** / **Consider:** | Suggestion — worth thinking about, not required |
| **FYI** | Informational — no action needed |

**Lead with what matters.** Correctness and security first, structural regressions and missed simplifications next, everything else after. Don't bury one real problem under ten nitpicks — a single structural issue **is** the review.

## Don't accept "I'll clean it up later"

In practice, deferred cleanup mostly never happens. Either require it in this change, or if it's genuinely urgent, file a separate issue **with an owner assigned to it.**
